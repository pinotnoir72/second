<blockquote>
<p>Owned and operated by sister Nellie and Meli, Bike A Rama Bicycles has been serving Jacksonville since 1991. We are proud to be the hippest bike shop in Jacksonville and we donâ€™t take this achievement lightly. While others have come and gone, Bik A Rama has thrived because of our love for cycling and our belief in customer service, community outreach, and providing you the best products at the best prices. </p>
<p>Whether it was a Western Flyer 30 years ago, a Schwinn 30 years ago, or a Trek bicycle today, we are constantly expanding our services to suit your needs. We stock a full complement of accessories and bicycles and are the largest recumbent bicycle dealer in north Florida. Stop by today just to say hi or test ride your next bike. </P>
